## Lecturing Format

-   Lecture notes will be provided but please take additional notes as
    needed.

    relevant.

-   Please ask questions.

## What is this course about?

-   The goal of this course is to introduce you to Bayesian Data
    Analysis (BDA).

-   BDA relies on two foundational ideas

    -   The first idea behind Bayesian inference is the updating of
        uncertainty across possibilities.

    -   The second idea is that parameter values are given probability
        distributions, known as “prior” distributions.

“How often have I said to you that when you have eliminated the
impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth” -
Sherlock Holmes (fictional character)

## What topics will we cover?

This course will cover (but is not limited to) the following topics:

-   Bayes’ Rule
-   Inferring a Binomial Probability
-   Prior Distributions
-   Markov Chain Monte Carlo
-   Gibbs Sampler
-   Assessing Model Convergence
-   JAGS
-   Simple Models with JAGS
-   Hierarchical Models with JAGS
-   Model Checking

## Diversity & inclusion

It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful
of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic
status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture. I may not
always get this right so please let me know ways to improve the
effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or
student groups.

To help with this:

-   If you have a name that differs from those that appear in your
    official University records, please let me know!

-   Please let me know your preferred pronouns if you wish to do so.

-   I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about
    diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class
    (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me
    about it.
